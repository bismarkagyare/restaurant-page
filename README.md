# Restaurant Website

This is a simple restaurant website that showcases the menu and information about the restaurant. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together with Webpack. The goal was to demonstrate how we understood Webpack by building this project.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS 
* JavaScript
* Wepback

## Features

* Home page with introduction to the restaurant
* Menu page with a list of food items and their prices
* Contact page with our location map and telephone

## Challenges Faced 

* Managing the visibility of the menu items when switching between the home and menu pages. Thus, writing the logic for the tab switching was quite challenging and fun on the side.

* Styling the menu items to display in a grid format

## What I learned

This project helped me to learn and reinforce my understanding of the following concepts:

* HTML and CSS layout and design
* JavaScript functions and DOM manipulation
* The use of Wepback
